# Smashing-Magazine-Heatmap

![screenshot](/screenshot.png)

The intention of this project was to practice visual hierarchy, cloning the main structure of the Smashing magazine home page and using a 4-unit grayscale, to order from the most attractive to the least attractive elements of each section. Mostly it was built with a 4 column grid layout and a bunch of div elements.
